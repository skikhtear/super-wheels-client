                    </h2>
                    <p>Local (UI) state – Local state is data we manage in one or another component.

                        Local state is most often managed in React using the useState hook.

                        For example, local state would be needed to show or hide a modal component or to track values for a form component, such as form submission, when the form is disabled and the values of a form’s inputs.

                        Global (UI) state – Global state is data we manage across multiple components.

                        Global state is necessary when we want to get and update data anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least.

                        A common example of global state is authenticated user state. If a user is logged into our app, it is necessary to get and change their data throughout our application.

                        Sometimes state we think should be local might become global.

                        Server state – Data that comes from an external server that must be integrated with our UI state.

                        Server state is a simple concept, but can be hard to manage alongside all of our local and global UI state.

                        There are several pieces of state that must be managed every time you fetch or update data from an external server, including loading and error state.

                        Fortunately there are tools such as SWR and React Query that make managing server state much easier.

                        URL state – Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query parameters.

                        URL state is often missing as a category of state, but it is an important one.
                        In many cases, a lot of major parts of our application rely upon accessing URL state. Try to imagine building a blog without being able to fetch a post based off of its slug or id that is located in the URL!

                        There are undoubtedly more pieces of state that we could identify, but these are the major categories worth focusing on for most applications you build.

                    </h2>
                    <p>JavaScript is a bit confusing for developers experienced in class-based languages (like Java or C++), as it is dynamic and does not have static types.

                        When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain. It is possible to mutate any member of the prototype chain or even swap out the prototype at runtime, so concepts like static dispatching do not exist in JavaScript.

                        While this confusion is often considered to be one of JavaScript's weaknesses, the prototypical inheritance model itself is, in fact, more powerful than the classic model. It is, for example, fairly trivial to build a classic model on top of a prototypical model — which is how classes are implemented.

                        Although classes are now widely adopted and have become a new paradigm in JavaScript, classes do not bring a new inheritance pattern. While classes abstract most of the prototypical mechanism away, understanding how prototypes work under the hood is still useful.

                    </h2>

                    <h4 className='font-bold'>What is a Unit Test?</h4>
                    <p>A unit test verifies the behavior of a unit of software in the system. It verifies whether a small and isolated piece of the codebase called “unit” behaves as the developer intended.

                        Unit tests verify the smallest parts or components of an application by comparing their actual behavior with the expected behavior in complete isolation. Here, “complete isolation” means that, during unit testing, devs do not connect the application with external dependencies such as databases, the filesystem, or HTTP services. This allows unit tests to be fast and stable since they won’t fail due to problems integrating with those external services.

                    </p>
                    <h4 className='font-bold'> Why should we write unit tests?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Usually, developers write unit tests first, then write the software code. This approach is known as test-driven development (TDD). In TDD, the requirements are turned into specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests. In the case of unit tests, it allows for the modification of code without affecting the functionality of other units or the software in its entirety. This makes the job easier for developers as the bugs are easy to locate at this stage, which saves time and money.

                        Also, within unit test environments, the individual modules of a product become isolated from one another and have their own area of responsibility. In this scenario, tests are more reliable because they are run in a contained environment. The code too, because of said reliability, becomes reliable.

                    </h2>

                    <h4 className='font-bold'>Data Binding</h4>
                    <p>Angular.js uses the two-way binding. The state of the model is changed first, and then the modification of the interface element is reflected. The interface element changes as the model’s state changes, which is why two-way data binding is used.

                        React.js has one-way binding. First, the state of the model is updated, and then it reflects the change of the interface element. If you change the interface element, the state of the model stays the same.

                        As on Angular, the data binding on Vue.js is two-way. Vue.js synchronizes the entire model with the DOM mechanically. This implies that all Vue.js templates are fundamentally legal, parsable HTML with a few extra features. Remember this because Vue templates are fundamentally different from string-based templates.

                    <h4 className='font-bold'>Syntax</h4>
                    <p>Angular is written in TypeScript, which means you need some time to learn it to work with this framework.

                        React uses JSX and native Javascript developers are familiar with it. The training period is easier and does not require that much preparation.

                        Vue.js makes use of an HTML-based template syntax that allows you to link the displayed DOM to the data of the base element instance declaratively. All Vue.js templates are valid HTML that can be read by HTML analyzers and browsers that follow the standard.</p>
